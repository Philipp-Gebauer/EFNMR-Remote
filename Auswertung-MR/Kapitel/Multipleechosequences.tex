    \caption[]{ask: what does pulse phase degree between \SI{90}{\degree} and \SI{180}{\degree} (or also between \SI{180}{\degree} and \SI{180}{\degree}) mean (Anleitung 9.)? Is it the time between the pulses? \newline
    difference between alternating and constant \SI{180}{\degree} pulse phase\newline
    we only have data for 180 pulse phase degrees in \SI{270}{\degree} and \SI{90}{\degree}, but those two are the same and this is good, but we don´t hae values for \SI{180}{\degree} example.\newline
    we didn´t make measurements about 90 pulse phase degree}
