\section{Part I -- Basics}
\label{sec:PartI}
This part of the report discusses all the measurments made on the first day of the experiment and their analysis.
The focus is therefore on the basics of this whole experiment. Those include a noise measurment, an basic analysis of the used coils, elementary characterizations of a water sample and tuning the setup on this, an analysis of the  longitudinal and transversal relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$ respectively as well as the principle of \textsc{Hahn} echos and different possible applications of it.
