\section{Setup}
\label{sec:Aufbau}
This chapter is about the setup of this experiment.
To understand which part of the experiment has what use, it is necessary to have a look at the components of the setup.\newline
Figure \ref{fig:Aufbau} shows the different coils which are necessary for the EFNMR measurement.
The inner coil B$_1$ is the excitation and collection coil which is described in the previous chapter.
The outer coil is used to prepolarize the sample.
This is necessary to obtain a strong signal.
By applying a strong magnetic field, all spins align in the direction of the prepolarising pulse and provide a bulk polarised nuclear magnetisation across the sample.
The middle coil is called the gradient coil.
This coil erases the inhomogeneous magnetic field which always occurs for different uncertainty reasons.
This coil is also used for the 2D imaging of the probe by adjusting the components of the magnetic field.\newline
The z-axis of the whole setup of coils has to be aligned parallel to the earths magnetic field.
Therefore a compass can be used to adjust the position.
Via the computer program \textit{Prospa} and the spectrometer, the currents of the coil can be adjusted and the induced signals can be measured.

    On the left-hand side the coils B$_1$ (excitation and collection coil), gradient coil (homogeneous magnetic field and 2D scanning coil) and the prepolarising coil B$_p$ are displayed.
    The right-hand side shows the water sample which has been used and the spectrometer which adjusts the necessary signals to the coils. \cite{Bild}}
