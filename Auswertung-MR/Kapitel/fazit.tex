\section{Error discussion and conclusion}
\label{sec:Fazit}
Despite all measured data make sense and are consistent with the literature, there are also errors which occured. Lets begin by the setup and its position itself. Due to the orientation and position in the room the noise level in chapter \ref{sec:Noisemeasurement} changes a lot. The noise level \SI{7.5}{\mu \volt} is a value below \SI{10}{\mu \volt} and therefore a acceptable noise level. To achieve excellent results it is even though necessary to have a noise level below \SI{3}{\mu \volt}. Furthermore some of the measured data depend on the earths magnetic field and since this is not really strong (magnitude \si{\nano \tesla}) even small metal objects can change its properties. The influence of the light source and the computer display were already discussed in the chapter \ref{sec:Noisemeasurement}. Even though the gradient coil should erase all inhomogeneous components of the magnetic field, there is always a slight propability that it is not homogeneous.\newline
Another imperfection of the experiment is the duration of the pulses and the phases. With the help of figure \ref{fig:B1dauer} we analyzed that the B$_1$ duration for a \SI{90}{\degree} pulse is \SI{1.35}{\milli \second}. Since the measurement steps in the figure \ref{fig:B1dauer} are rather high, the duration could also change a little. This error has a huge impact when it comes to the \textit{Hahn} echo and the CPMG method and thus changes T$_2$.

Despite all errors the results confirm the theorey and are consistent with the literature. This is allocable by the values for T$_{1,p}$ of \SI{2912.8800 \pm 0.0048}{\milli \second} and for T$_{1,e}$ of \SI{2753.0500 \pm 0.0012}{\milli \second} and for the measurements of T$_2$ of \SI{2317.76000 \pm 0.00062}{\milli \second}. The research of the hydrogen signal in a pulse and collect experiment results in a width of the peak at half maximum (FWHM) of \SI{1.177 \pm 0.042}{\hertz} and is therefore really small. With the help of those values, the discussion of the values and the detailed introduction, the experiment shows the properties of a basic ENMR experiment quite good.
