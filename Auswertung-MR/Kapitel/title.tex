    \noindent The aim of this paper is to show the principals of an EFNMR measurement and to discuss its results.\newline
    The first part of the experiment is about the basic principal of EFNMR measurements. Therefore the noise level is taken to account and is identifeid to be \SI{7.5}{\mu \volt} for our setup. The analysis of the B$_1$ coil results in a capacity of \SI{13.8}{\nano \farad} for the LCR circuit in order to tune the circuit to the lamor frequency of \SI{1841.4}{\hertz}. To obtain a sharp peak in the spectrum for the measured hydrogen signal the system was tuned to following values: shimming values $x = \SI{10.11}{\milli \ampere}, \ y = \SI{20.88}{\milli \ampere}, \ z = \SI{-20.07}{\milli \ampere}$; B$_1$ pulse duration \SI{1.35}{\milli \second}; capacity \SI{13.8}{\nano \farad}. The relaxation time measurements in the polarizing field results in values for T$_{1,p}$ of \SI{2912.8800 \pm 0.0048}{\milli \second}. The relaxation time measurements in the earths magnetic field results in values for T$_{1,e}$ of \SI{2753.0500 \pm 0.0012}{\milli \second}. The measurements of T$_2$ results in values of \SI{2691 \pm 12}{\milli \second} with single \textit{Hahn} echos and \SI{2317.76000 \pm 0.00062}{\milli \second} with the use of 30 echos in a CPMG.
